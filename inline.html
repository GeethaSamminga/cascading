<p style="background-color: antiquewhite;">On the eve of the formation of Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission, Andhra Public Service Commission was functioning with a Chairman and two Members and Hyderabad Public Service Commission was functioning with one Member. Hence, A.P. Public Service Commission was constituted with a Chairman and 3 Members. With increasing workload, Government enhanced the strength of the Commission to Chairman and 5 Members in the year 1981 and later to Chairman and 7 Members in the year 1983. The government again reviewed the strength in 1994 and enhanced it to Chairman and 9 Members. This is the present strength also.[1] After the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in accordance to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 the Head quarters of PSC was shifted from Telangana to Vijayawada.
